            "description": "During my internship in the Innovation Department at Mercer (Summer 2018), I lead the design and implementation of a brand new web app that modernized the data collection process for one of the companyâ€™s consulting services. The old process relied on excel spreadsheets and although an effort to modernize had been made, virtually no progress was achieved. I was brought in to fix this system. After analyzing the requirements and looking at what had already been done, I decided the system needed to be completely rewritten to use an up-to-date framework and a more scalable, modular architecture. I redesigned the entire system from the database schema, to the backend API, to the frontend interface to meet the requirements. In addition to this web app, I also consulted with upper management on the technical side of some potential new products. About halfway through my internship, another, less experienced developer (straight from high school) was hired and I was given the unique opportunity to mentor another developer.",

At Inkbox, I got to work under a much more experienced developer where I learned how to design software that was maintainable and scalable well into the future. The internship was scheduled for 2 months, but after realizing my value, Inkbox extended it into August and hired a developer to take my place at the end of my internship.",
